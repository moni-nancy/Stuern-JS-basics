6. **Static typed programming language**  can make a program more secure and less prone to bugs, as the compiler can catch type errors before the program is executed while a **Dynamic typed programming language**, on the other hand, can make the code more flexible and easier to write, as the programmer does not need to specify the type of every variable.

In a **statically typed programming language**, the type of a variable must be specified when it is declared, and it cannot change during the execution of the program. Examples are: Java, C++ . While in 
**dynamically typed programming language**, the type of a variable can change during the execution of the program and is determined at runtime. Exmples: Python,  JavaScript.


7.  'Undefined' indicates that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value, while 'null' indicates that a variable has been declared and has been explicitly assigned a non-value.
